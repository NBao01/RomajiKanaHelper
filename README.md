## Update

In 2023/10/21's Update, I add audios to each Kana so that you can play each audio and listen the correct pronunciation easily. The audios are intercepted from Bilibili Video [BV1Pa411a77A](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Pa411a77A) by Kokonoe Yukari. She is my Daisuki-na Vtuber.

## Introduction

This project can help you memorize Japanese Kanas by randomly show each Kana with Rōmaji.

Also, you can change the Rōmaji Systems, whether Hebon-shiki Rōmaji System or Kunrei-shiki Rōmaji System. Additionally, you can choose any different combinations by selecting different Rōmaji-Kana set, for example, standard Gojūon, Dakuon/Handakuon, or Yōon.
